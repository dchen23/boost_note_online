  # OSPP ch2
  
  When running the operating system kernel, the processor is like a warden in charge of an insane asylum with complete access to everything. At other times, the processor runs application code in a process â€” the processor becomes an inmate, wearing a straightjacket locked in a padded cell by the warden, protected from harming anyone else.
  
  applications cannot disable processor interrupts
